In this step, you will prepare a simple application that can be deployed.
Execute the following commands to clone the sample application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-node.git
$ cd cf-sample-app-node
</pre>

You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple application as well as a `package.json` file, which is used by Nodeâ€™s dependency manager npm.
